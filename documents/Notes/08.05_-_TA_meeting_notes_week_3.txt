1. Catch up:
ALL : Table of contents
Stefan : 
Radu : Connected frontend and backend through endpoints
Paul : SQL Database for the annotations + dependencies on gradle
Rebeca: Frontend 
Calin: Pipeline + checkstyle

2. Review project plan feedack

Section 1.1: Rewrite, it is mostly a solution not the problem statement
Section 1.2.3: We did not explain what tools we will use ( We are just using PDFBox )
Section 3.1.2: We did not explain why we chose Java ( we chose based on the available frameworks )
Section 3.1.3: We did not explain how we decide what is impractical
Section 4.1.1: We did not explain what machine readable format is ( plain text )
Section 4.2: No justifications for the numbers used + vague statement

3. Review Table of Contents

Everything looks good. The sections might change when we start writing the full report

Calin: Apply ner to our output with a python script
Stefan + Radu: Work on table parsing + start the annotation tool

6. Additional Notes
Midterm presentation : Thursday, May 30th, week 4.6 at 11:00 AM
We are expected to finish must haves in week 8. Project seems too simplistic, so we will need to brainstorm for new requirements
