Notes client:

Fixes:

- add code: alert if the code already exists 

- html when hovering over codes ( use a dropdown instead of the html title )

- add autosave to codes

- improve security

- remove debugging button from parsing.html

- button to clean up database - clears database of submissions

- if one users is annotating a file, lock the file so others cannot change it

- dashboard - separate lists with submitted and not submitted files; recently edited can be removed

- also display time not just date on recently edited

- display the group of the report

- deployment???

- uploading a file manually for admins in case a student submits his work after deadline


Presentation tips:
showcase why it is better to use our app instead of an external tool to annotate
we can say something about the autosave / database situation
