Demo feedback:
- Possible questionon final presentation: why not just use Brightspace?
	=> predefined codes, not on brightspace
	=> the purpose of the tool is to also collect the data
	=> On brightspace, annotation seems less intuitive    
                                           
- What to do when we have late submissions, making the teacher reupload the files:
	=> We don't have a solution to this, we need think about it and put in the paper
	=> Documenting this will help the grade
	=> Currently, the students that already have submissions will be ignored and will not be overwritten
	=> Idea: ignore the file if the file contains annotations, overwrite otherwise
	=> Put it in the report, even if we dont find a solution

- Purpose of the report?
	=> Analysing development process or analyzing the feasibality
	=> Focus on development process

- How long should each user session last?
	=> not important, will be SSO either way
	=> 30 minutes is ok for now, maybe an hour

- What should happen if 2 professors annotate the same file at the same time?
	=> Idea1: lock the file when is edited, unlock when the save button is pressed
	=> Idea2: Keep version of file, if save is clicked make new version
		=> keep changes from one, but work will be lost
		=> keep changes from both professors, notify both
	=> Client prefers idea1, temporary lock the file

- We can send the slides for the presentation on mattermost for feedback
