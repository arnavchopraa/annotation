Notes Monday 20.5.2024:

- Catching up:
Rebecca on frontend: Pages that reflect client's desires for this week
Table parsing done
Stefan on preprocessing
Radu on table processing and cleaning repository
Calin finished python script
Paul researching on captions

- Organizational scheduling:
Midterm presentation: 30th May 11:00 Mirzakhani (2.W950) in Building 28 (VMB)
Endterm presentation: Client prefers Monday after 1 o'clock; TA prefers 1:00 - 2:30; Coach available anytime on Monday
No separate TA meeting next week -> Only midterm presentation

Midterm presentation:
- Content: Check in -> everything done so far, issues with brightspace
		-> Refinement on requirements: talk about that!!
		-> Problem statement present
		-> Live demo; Comments on code; README
		-> Not worth talking about scrum too much, more about project
		-> Q&A estimated: 10 minutes; total time of presentation is 15 minutes
		-> Up to us whether script is necessary. Powerpoint is necessary, with slides.
		-> Also talk about progress on requirements, what is left, how we plan to overcome future difficulties
		-> At least one time everyone presents, but everyone should answer Q&A in both presentations
- Presentation strategy does not really matter, up to us
- Rebecca Radu and Calin in midterm presentation, Stefan Paul and someone else in the endterm.
- Client has changed project expectations -> maybe reach compromise until midterm presentation
- Requirements have to be updated because of this
- Inform client on the compromises, and that we will not be finishing by Thursday
- Client's promises are not kept or maybe delayed.
- By the next meeting, we should have this cleared up 100%
- Code first, then research (as focus)
- It's expected that we have more code, more commits, more MR's. 
- !! Way too little code -> start working more
- Issues are not properly represented -> too little.
- Contribution to MR's is not equal -> reviews, comments etc.
- Code and Test contribution is not equal -> catch up on that

Requirement split:
- Login functionality maybe
- Testing 
- Create a global database
- Database for PDF files.
- Exporting files individually - Stefan
- Supporting multiple files

- On Thursday meeting with the client - be definitive so we can get back on track
- Buddycheck: released this week
