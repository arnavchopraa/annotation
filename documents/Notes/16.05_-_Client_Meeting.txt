Date: 11.00 - 12.00, 16.05.2024
Present: Rebecca, Radu, Paul, Stefan, Calin, TA Andreea
Chairman: Calin
Note Taker: Rebecca




Organizational:
* Midterm: 30th of May, 11 am
* Endterm: preferably Monday after 1.30pm, but could do Tuesday at 11 am, but also  as well
* Next meeting: 23.05 at 10am - 11am - regular meeting
* Week 6 presentation meeting




General Notes:
* parse appendices as well (rn we’re ignoring everything below Reference)
* make an interface to add new codes in the database
* second scenario: 
   * extract reports through Brightspace and assign them to supervisors (export everything from Brightspace and import everything to our tool)
      * we need SSO integration - do basic login until we get in touch with the Brightspace people
   * supervisor should see only the reports they’re assigned to through our tool
   * they can open the pdf
   * they should add annotations directly through our tool
   * they should be able to submit the annotated pdf anonymously and for it to go back to the student on Brightspace => they should be saved into some form of database
   * they should be able to download the pdf in its original form along with the new annotations, having the original images, tables, etc
   * they should also be able to download the parsed text as a .txt, for LLM training purposes
* see if we can batch-download PDFs and link the batch to the supervisor net id
   * pdfs should be grouped by supervisors (?)
   * add student number to the name of the pdf so it’s easier to match it
* should be able to select text and select codes, as well as free type => you can’t add more codes, but coordinators should be able to define those codes
* ideally, when the pdf is uploaded, it should have 0 annotations




Questions:
* Brightspace? They replied they received the email - Gosia will get in touch with the CEO of FeedbackFruits
   * start building the website 
* can we get a database running from TU Delft?
   * will get back to you on that
* when we parse a PDF, the line length is kept, it just adds a new line character, and we lose images and tables. is it necessary for the downloaded PDF to be in the same format, with the tables and everything
   * yes, for the second scenario it must look the same
   * after it has been annotated, it should be parsed into a text file and annotate it
* how much do captions matter? 
   * parse them separately, and mark them as related to an image, they should be separate
   * main text, references, captions, and appendices
   * references should be before appendices if people write it properly
* will it always be just the 1st letter capitalized? ideally yes, but you can’t count on that
* can you send us the contact information for a Brigthspace systems engineer from TU Delft? 
   * yes, will do later




Feedback:
* just converting to PDF is sufficient, no need for new paragraphs => download the original one
* the short lines don’t matter - it’s not necessary to remove the ‘\r’
* make the website look a bit better
* add a readme of the project
   * include how to add new categories


Conclusion:
* Gosia should create a sendbox and give us access so we can experiment with batch-downloads
* CONTACT BRIGHTSPACE!!!
* get adding annotations functional
