Notes Week 2

Catch up:
- we need review code of conduct
- we need to get in touch with the coach


What slowed us down:
- a lot of information as we just started
- waiting on getting to know the clients expectations
how could we fix this: gitlab issues


Whats left of the project planning:
- risk analysys
- review feasability study
- add more requiremens engineering
- development approach
- we have enough scientific sources ( although some may need to be changed from websites to scientific articles )
( references will be checked by research team) reference = scientific article ( exp: on google scholar )


Work split:
calin - scientific resources
radu - rephrasing
stefan - development approach
rebecca - review


Code of Conduct:
- needs review


Application scenarios:
- we can use the libraries ( but we would still need to work on something else)
- if we dont use it, we can write about it and explain why we didn't

- this week we can start coding the application ( after the deadline for the project plan )


Pipeline:

- calin is working on it

what should fail pipeline:
- checkstyle ( indentation, long line, max method parameters, javadoc only for the code part )
- code not running
- tests failing




Organizational ( next week ):

- ta meeting - wednesday 16:00 ( pc-1 )
- client - wednesday 10:00
- contact the coach!
- midterm meeting will be in week 6
- endterm - monday preffered by client

- we could do more thorough task division
- think about the tasks for next week

- talk to client to maybe add more requirements

- will we receive feedback on pipeline? no

- gitlab:
introduce approval rule - each merge request requires an approval

Requirements Engineering:
- need more for must's ( needs to be enough work for at least 5-6 weeks )
- we could move the shoulds relating to annotation tool to must

- all sections of moscow should be roughly equal?
yes, it's a general rule
- don't leave won't haves with only 2-3 things (think about things that people would expect from the tool, but it doesn't do them )


Feedback on the agenda:
- add timestamps
