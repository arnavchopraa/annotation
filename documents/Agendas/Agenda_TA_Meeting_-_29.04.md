# Approval of the agenda
After everyone is comfortable, any suggestions can be added to the agenda or changes to the topics.

# Catching up
See what progress has been done. Everyone presents their own contribution to tasks, see what has been done and what is left unfinished from the previous week.

# Slowing down
See what slowed down the progress of tasks. Discuss what could have been done differently and what improvements can be made such that we are more efficient.

# Points of action
